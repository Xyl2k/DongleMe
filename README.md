# DongleMe

## INTRODUCTION

This project uses the [MASM32 SDK](https://www.masm32.com/) and [WinASM](https://code.google.com/archive/p/winasm-studio/).  
  
That just some materials i did for a presentation and a paper (private sorry) about software protection for a con in 2017.  
This repository include code projects in assembly to try my Rockey4ND dongle and an emulator tied to it compatible with theses codes.

## BUILDING

There is a file, called **make.bat**, which will build the executable file for theses projects.  
Reading this file is the way to understand the build process.

- /DongleAPI/  - Utility to try to interact with a plugged dongle
- /DongleTest/ - Utility doing multiple write/read operations, based on the Feitian SDK V1.30 examples
- /DongleMe/Envelope/ - Empty shell, for the Feitian Shell Protect Center 1.0.10.105
- /DongleMe/NoEnvelope/ - Very basic example on how to tie a program to a dongle without Feitian Shell Protect Center
- /DongleDump/ - Utility to dump the memory zone 1 and memory zone 2 of a Rockey4ND dongle

## WHAT'S INTERESTING?

You will have fews examples on how to import the ROCKEY4ND DLL API Library in ressouce, drop it and load it.  
Another interesting code can be my procedure to retrieve P1, P2 from an input and move it into a DW variable.  
DongleDump include few procedures to hex write and wrap the text with comas, backward slash and carriage return.

If you want to play with my emulated dongle the 4 passwords are:  
P1: **4839**  
P2: **4BBB**  
P3: **4B31**  
P4: **4847**
